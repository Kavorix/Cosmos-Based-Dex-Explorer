`Dexplorer` is a disposable light explorer for Cosmos-based blockchains. It is designed to connect to any Cosmos SDK chain using only WebSocket RPC. This can be useful when developing Cosmos-based chains and exploring blockchain data through a UI.

### How is Dexplorer different from other explorers?

`Dexplorer` is only a frontend app, meaning there is no cache or pre-processing. It pulls data from RPC as needed.
